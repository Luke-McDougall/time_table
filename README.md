Personal practice/educational project. This is a simple command line program that 
prints my time table information. 
Currently it supports:
1. Hard coded time table info some of which is printed depending on what day it is.
2. A file based todo list system that prints items in green if they have been completed
   and in red if they are uncompleted.
3. A command line switch '-t' which will make the program print the current day's time
   table as well as the next day's. Friday wraps around to monday.

I plan to test some different implementation techniques for the features I already have
and to add a more long term calender like system that prints information about important
upcoming events within a certain time period before they happen. Probably one week.
